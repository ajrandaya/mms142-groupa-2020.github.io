                                    Mostly the same as physical consultation. We
                                    sent my parents’ laboratory results through
                                    Viber and explained it to us through a Zoom
                                    meeting. But services can really be limited
                                    especially when you are needed to be
                                    physically inspected. Teleconsultation can
                                    be great for initial check-ups.”

So I think my consultation with the doctor is not worth it since the rate is just the same as traditional consultations.

But knowing the situation about the internet connection in our country, sometimes there are technical difficulties so you cannot clearly hear each other. Some also consider sending results during consultations a hassle, though for some it is convenient. Prescriptions are easier to understand since they send digital copies of it instead of handwritten. Though I do believe traditional or usual physical consultations are still better in some cases. During physical consultations, we can express thoroughly how we feel and what we feel. You can also see actual presentations of the results of your tests, most especially if they are also done physically. Other than that, you are able to communicate with the doctor without interruptions.”</p>

                                    Telemedicine has been a major beneficiary of our digital world and has the capacity to revolutionize the delivery of healthcare. “Practice of telemedicine” means the use of electronic information and communication technologies to provide health care when distance separates participants. It is known to be the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using telecommunications technology. This includes phone calls at the basic level, but has grown to include video calling, electronic messaging, and mobile technologies.

                                    The basic premise of telemedicine is to offer convenience for the patient and reduce the amount of potential travel required for both physician and patient. It supports efforts to significantly improve the quality of healthcare by increasing accessibility and efficiency through providing clinical support, overcoming geographic barriers, offering various types of communication devices, and improving patient outcomes. This practice has many apparent and valuable aspects for expanding access to healthcare providers and may lead to cost savings for both patients and providers. Among other benefits, the use of telemedicine improves follow-up care, ensures patient access to services, and allows providers to treat patients at home and in remote areas. Despite its advocates and major advancements, there are certainly critical challenges that need to be resolved. Telemedicine applications are not indicative of “real” nursing and can possibly lead to misdiagnosis —this may stem from liability concerns and discomfort over not seeing a client face-to-face. There are possible threats to patient safety when telemedicine applications fail to render the same level of care as hands-on care or when problems occur with the use of electrical devices.

                                    Technological innovation and the unprecedented surge in illness from COVID-19 creates an increasing demand for interest in telemedicine. However, it is this time or period also that we were able to assess the efficiency of this disruptive technology. The practice of telemedicine is diverse, experimental, evolving and at the same time disrupting the traditional health care delivery. The major dilemmas are now emphasized—there are regulations that impede telemedicine, there are services a physician can’t provide with telemedicine, and other applications of telemedicine is not sufficient (e.g. physical check-ups, elderly who can’t manage the device, etc.). 
                                </p>

                                    As with any disruptive innovation, it takes time, validation, and the right catalyst before it becomes fully embraced by the society. Therefore, it is evident that we are still in the early stage of practicing telemedicine and we cannot completely consider this practice to replace traditional health care delivery. Moreover, given its premises and potential dilemmas, successful establishment and implementation of a telemedicine plan requires strategic planning and consideration of the following—necessary infrastructure, costs and reimbursement, human factors, equipment, and technology issues.
